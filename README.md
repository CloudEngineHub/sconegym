# sconegym
Gym environments for SCONE. Useful for biomechanics research using Reinforcement Learning.

## Prerequisits
Before using sconegym, make sure you have the following installed:
* The latest version of SCONE (download [here](https://scone.software))
* Python 3.9

## Installation
To install sconegym, navigate to the folder where you downloaded the sconegym repository and type:

```
pip install -e .
```

The `-e` flag will cause the package to directly use the code at the repository location, so that it automatically gets updated when you update the sconegym repository. If you do not want that, leave out the `-e` option.
